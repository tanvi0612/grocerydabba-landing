                growth startup. If everything looks good, you are featured on

                We have been in the Indian Startup ecosystem helping build and
                nurture it for over 6 years now. In the process, we have built a
                direct network with the founders of almost every high growth
                startup, which means that apart from the 60 partners we have
                right now(including smallcase, exotel, one of the largest
                fintech companies of Japan who has set foot in India and more),
                it is only a matter of time when the number of partner companies
                will cross 200(with the likes of PayTm, Oyo, Flipkart etc)

                No, it is a private newsletter and no one can see it. Also when
                your name goes out there is no other information that helps a
                company identify who you are. We will exclude the company you
                are presently in from the newsletter(featuring you) to ensure it
